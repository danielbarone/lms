# LMS Project

Library Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for all library-related needs. Users can log on as one of three user types: administrator, borrower, or librarian. As administrators, users can manage all aspects of a library, including adding or updating details of available books and overriding the due date for a specific loan. As borrowers, users are able to easily checkout and return books using their card numbers. Finally, as librarians, users can update the details of their library branches and manage the number of copies available for any given book. LMS employs React for a responsive user interface, Java for reliable back-end services, and AWS for seamless and scalable deployment.
